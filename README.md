This is a work in progress (WIP) for an upcoming modding platform for OSRS, inspired by the Garry's Mod, Roblox, Fortnite, Dreams, and Minecraft modding communities. The hope is to enable the creation of custom playable MMO content in the live game, such as new maps, skills, quests, raids, and minigames, by leveraging the RuneLite API to change what is drawn on screen. It is powered by a high performance megaserver, built from scratch close to the metal, that is being designed to support up to 131k concurrent online OSRS players in real-time with a hard guarantee of never having server lag.

Note: This is *NOT* a RSPS. This does not interface with Jagex's patented protocol. You also remain logged into Jagex's servers at all times.

Current Features:
- Megaserver (cross-world play and chat with others on other worlds)
- Live Hiscores (watch ranks change every tick; enables post-200m training)
